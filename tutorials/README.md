## Differences between Metalsmith CLI and Metalsmith with JavaScript (Node.js).
A brief but succinct description.

## Installation
Metalsmith uses Node.js. 

### Install Node

[Use NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script)
Metalsmith recommends using Node.js version 4 however it works well on v0.12 and after.
```bash
nvm install v4
```

#### Windows
Provide link or installation method.



# Tutorials
